1. *Check your system version*

    `lsb_release -a`
    - In my case the result was:
        ```
         Distributor ID:    Ubuntu
         Description:    Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
         Release:    18.04
         Codename:    bionic
        ```
    We are interested in `Codename`. In my case it was "bionic".

2. *Download fish-shell*.

    Go to download side of fish-shell https://launchpad.net/~fish-shell/+archive/ubuntu/release-3/+packages 
    (Currently the latest version is "release-3", if you are not sure, you can go https://fishshell.com, and select tab Linux, and Ubuntu download link)
    
    You will see a list of fish-shell versions, and you need to select one with corresponding `Codename` as your system, in my case it was a "bionic", so I select it, then select arm64, and then download file with arm64.deb at the end. For me it was `fish_3.7.1-1~bionic_arm64.deb`
    
    By default files download into `Downloads` folder, so you should see it there. 

3. *Install fish-shell*

    Go to your terminal of choice, and go to folder fish-shell deb file is located, and run following command:
    `sudo apt install ./your_fish_shell.deb`
    for me it was:
    `sudo apt install ./fish_3.7.1-1~bionic_arm64.deb` 
    And it should start installation processes.
    When it installs it, you can check it by typing
    `fish` in the console, and it will welcome you into fish-shell.

4. *Selection fish-shell by default*

    So to switch to fish-shell you need to type this command:
    `chsh -s $(which fish)` or `sudo chsh -s $(which fish)`
    Now, you should reboot the system so everything would be applied
    `sudo apt reboot`
    And after reboot, you should just open the console, and the good, nice looking, fish shell. :)
